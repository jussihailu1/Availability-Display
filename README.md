# Availability Display
 Availability Display POC
 
All classes are made by me except for:
- [SerialPort.java](https://github.com/jussihailu1/Availability-Display/blob/main/MyApplication/app/src/main/java/android_serialport_api/SerialPort.java): This class is the connection between the code and the leds. I did not touch this class.
- [LedControlUtil.java](https://github.com/jussihailu1/Availability-Display/blob/main/MyApplication/app/src/main/java/android_serialport_api/LedControlUtil.java): This class was made by the creators of the sample code of ProDVX. In this class I only added some code. The part where my code starts and ends is indicated using comments.
- [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/jussihailu1/Availability-Display/blob/main/MyApplication/app/src/main/java/com/example/myapplication/MainActivity.java): This is a basic class created by Android Studio when creating a project. It starts with the bare minimum to run an application. I added the rest.
- [colors.xml](https://github.com/jussihailu1/Availability-Display/blob/main/MyApplication/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml): This is also a basic class created by Android Studio. It is used to store colors. I also added some colors and commented on which were mine.
